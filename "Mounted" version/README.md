# "Mounted" version
When you compress the contents of this folder into an .exe file that execute Infector.exe automatically, you will have the malware executable. I called this folder "Mounted version".

# After compile

After you compile the source code, you need to replace some files in this folder with the compiled version of them. The files that need to be replaced are:

BSOD.exe;
Infector.exe;
LdaysPayloads.exe;
mbr.exe.
